# How to contribute

## Choosing an Issue
- Go through the list of issues on the repository for chatApp and feel free to choose an issue that has not been assigned to anyone.
- Preferably call dibs on the issue by commenting and letting the maintainers know you want to contribute to the code.

## Creating a Pull Request
- It's recommended that you create a new branch to work on.
- Write a fitting title and give appropriate details in the description while creating a Pull Request.
- Also try to attach relevant screenshots, if any.
- Please do not create PRs which are not resolving an already created issue. In order to streamline workflow, create an issue and get it assigned before submitting a pull request for it.

## Creating an Issue
- Feel free to report bugs/new features/enhancements/documentation errors in the repository's 'Issues' section.
